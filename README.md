# Zirah
Internship finder app
Zirah is a web-based Internship Finder application designed to bridge the gap between students and internship opportunities. The platform helps students discover relevant internships while providing administrators with tools to manage postings and users efficiently. The application is built using Java and Spring Boot on the backend, with Thymeleaf and Bootstrap for the frontend, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface.

The system allows students to create accounts, browse internship listings, and apply based on their interests and skills. Authentication modules such as Sign-Up and Sign-In ensure secure access. An Admin Panel is included to manage internship listings, monitor users, and control platform content.

Zirah follows the MVC (Model–View–Controller) architecture, which ensures clean separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability. Static resources such as images and stylesheets are efficiently handled using Spring Boot’s static resource management, while Thymeleaf enables dynamic rendering of views.

The application aims to simplify the internship search process, reduce manual effort, and provide equal access to opportunities for students, especially fresh graduates seeking practical industry experience.
